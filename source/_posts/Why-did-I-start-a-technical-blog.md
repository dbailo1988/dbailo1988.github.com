I am writing this post because I would like to expound what are the main reasons for me starting a technical blog. I want to focus in the two most important aspects in my opinion. First of all, I will explain why it is important to write your thoughts. Secondly, I will go about the social part and not being a Ghost Developer. 

### Why writing is important?
 
 * **Writing clarify your thoughts**
 Having the responsability of putting in sentences and structures your knowledge is a fight. When you have to explain an idea, you might realise you did not have that clear the expertise on it. Just as a fact, one day having breakfast with [Chris Heilmann](https://www.christianheilmann.com/), he stated that when he started his first book about JavaScript after being 5 years being a JavaScript developer. He noticed how little he knew about the language.
 
 * **Writing will improve your language skills**
 In my case, the blog's language is English and as a native Spanish speaker I have long way to go to improve my English. I like to challenge myself and I completely hate to use always the same words for expressing my ideas. So writing will force myself to start using more vocabulary. Also, I hope to get better at structuring the texts.
 
 * **Writing as a therapy** 
 When you are writing, you have to be concentrated. Therefore, during the writing time, you will not be thinking about other problems. Personally, my daily job is far from writing so since it is a different activity, I guess it will help me to evade myself.
 
 * **Writing will force you to read before**
 When you are writing about an idea, you first will have to read a bit about the topic, look for different approaches and finally make your idea clear. In this sense, it is a good practice because it makes you be updated with the topics you want to write about.
 
### Be social, don't be a ghost developer
 
 I think that the strongest motivation to start the blog, it was not being a [Ghost Developer](http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/02/the-ghost-who-codes-how-anonymity-is.html).
 Nowadays, exists lots of developers who do a good job, go everyday happily to their jobs, they are back home when the day is gone and noone on the internet know what are they doing. I felt a bit like this when I attended my first conference. In that moment, I thought that I should do something to change this. First conference day, I inmmediately started a twitter account.
 How being active in social networks can help you?
 
 * **Broaden your relations**
 When you are involved in the social networks on topics relevant to your field, you have the opportunity to know the best experts on your area. Overmore, in networks like Twitter or Disqus you can even reach these experts so easily.
 
 * **Improve your career**
 Today, every developer has a CV explaining their previous job and what they have achieved. What make you different from the rest? Does your name even appear on the internet? Every employer will look for your name on the internet. Being active in github, having an opinion on twitter, some highlights comments on StackOverflow, stating your point on disqus and so on. These are the facts that will make you different. I am not stating that a typical ghost developer would be unemployable. But for sure, it will be easier for a person who has been active.
 
 * **Being social shows your motivation**
 When you are spending part of your leisure time on being more social. You are already showing to the world that you have an extra interest for what you are doing and that you like and enjoy it.
 
Being said this, everyone can stop being this "Ghost developer" and start to give some knowledge back to the community and have an opinion about the different topics.
 
At the moment,  I am doing a short introduction course about [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) so I hope that my next post is already a bit more about coding.
 
If you kept till here, thanks for reading and share it if you liked it :)
