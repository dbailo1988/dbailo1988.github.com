Every other person always plans his personal new year resolutions. Sometimes it is about his health, new achivements, quiting bad habits or starting a new  discipline.

I want to publish publicly my new year resolutions so I will feel more guilty in case I do not accomplish them.

### My resolutions for 2016

I will introduce just the ones I want to give priority.

* **Start a blog**  
And here I am, I want to start my own blog and keep a frequency for posting and express my day by day at work and new technnology knowledge that I'm learning or give my point of view about new technologies comming. Basically as I stated in the description, I will write about my working life and technology which in my humble opinion it is pretty big area of discussion 

* **Run my first race** 
I have never run in my life in a real race. I have been thinking about it since long time ago and after discussing with different friends, I have decided to register to [Helsinki City Run](http://www.helsinkicityrun.fi/). So now it is time for preparing the race properly. Therefore, I will force myself to go outside for running even we are heading to a cold winter in Helsinki.

* **Puhutaan suomea**
Well I have been already over 4 years in Finland so I will try to take it as an action point and I will talk in Finnish always when a possible situation comes. My resolution is not being fluent by the next year but I definitely need to start talking finnish always when possible if I want to move on with this language.

I wanted to keep this post short since it is the only one which is going to be more personal so from here I say hi to the internet, hope we have a new blogger.

### tldr;

Planning my new year resolutions, write frequently in my blog, run the Helsinki City Run and keep practicing Finnish.
