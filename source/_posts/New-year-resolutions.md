This time of the year every other person is planning his personal new year resolutions. Sometimes they are on health, new achievements, quitting bad habits or starting a new  discipline.

I want to state publicly my new year resolutions so I will feel guilty if I do not accomplish them.

### My resolutions for 2016

I will list just the ones I want to give priority.

* **Start a blog**  
And here I am, I want to start my own blog and post regularly on my days at work, learnings on new technologies and my point of view in emerging ones. Basically, as I stated in the description, I will write about my working life and technology which in my humble opinion it is pretty large area of discussion 

* **Run my first race** 
I have never run a proper race but I have been thinking about it since long time ago and after discussing with different friends, I have decided to register to [Helsinki City Run](http://www.helsinkicityrun.fi/).Now I have to start preparing for the race properly, which means forcing myself to run outside even in the cold Helsinki winter.

* **Puhutaan suomea**
I have been already over 4 years in Finland, so I will try to make it an action point to talk Finnish whenever I can. My resolution is not about being fluent by the next year, but I definitely need to start talking Finnish more if I want to make progress with this language

I wanted to keep this post short since it is more on the personal side. I guess there is nothing more to say than say than "Hello internet, hopefully we have a new blogger now!".

### tldr;

Planning my new year resolutions, write regularly in my blog, run the Helsinki City Run and keep practicing Finnish.
