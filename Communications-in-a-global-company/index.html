    <h1 class="post-title">Communications in a global company</h1>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p>At the beginning of March, I was flown by my company, <a href="www.kiosked.com">Kiosked</a>, to Los Angeles. Kiosked is a global company with a finnish soul. We have offices around the world and in really different time zones. The main purpose of my trip was to speed up a project but meanwhile I learned many other aspects of the company. </p>
<p>Without noticing I felt a bit as a Finnish office’s embassador in the LA office. The company has been started in Finland and we have a strong and awesome culture. So I felt my role was also to spread this culture and atmosphere to the office in the West Coast of the USA. </p>
<p>Since the very first time in LA office, I noticed how difficult it was going to be the communications across the offices. As a anecdote, my first day I wanted to contact one of my colleagues in Finland and I realised that when I was starting my work day, they would be already out of the office time in the evening. I think it’s a fact that everyone knows by theory about the time zones but when you suffer them for real, it is when you understand is an issue to tackle. </p>
<p>But the time zones are not the only problem for communications when you have different offices. When you have a fast-paced growing company, new employees are joining every other week, email chains sometimes are just noise and the person who could help the better is not even there, not knowing to whom you are talking sometimes can produce misunderstandings and so on.</p>
<p>Therefore, I love the investment that Kiosked is doing flying people through the offices to improve the internal communications. When you get to know the person you are sending emails on daily basis, everything changes. Sharing time with your colleagues from different offices help you to understand their daily needs. It’s pretty useful also for aligning targets and knowing what could be improve to have our comms in better shape. At the end, we all are in the same boat, and we should row in the same direction. In the same way, there is a idiom which say <em>“A picture is worth thousand words”</em>, I would state <em>“A face to face chat is worth a thousand emails”</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, what I would like to remark the importance of being proactive when it goes to our duties. Sometimes it is not just about finishing our work and that’s it. Everyone should follow up, thinking on the big picture, who is going to use what you did, and if the person will know how to use it. Just stretching our roles a bit, the communications will work better.</p>
<p>To sum up, I want to say that I am so glad about the opportunity to go to Los Angeles office, my learning about different facets of the company has been great. Happy to say that we have awesome people on board.</p>
